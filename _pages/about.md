Anders Miltner is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Programming Languages at UT Austin's Computer Science department. I am working with [IÅŸil Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) and [Swarat Chaudhuri](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/).

Current Projects
======
* [Burst](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~amiltner/burst/) - Bottom-up synthesis of functional programs from logical specifications.
* [Hanoi](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~amiltner/hanoi/) - Generating representation invariants for data structure verification through a data-driven algorithm.

Selected Publications
======
* [Bottom-up Synthesis of Recursive Functional Programs using Angelic Execution](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~amiltner/burst.pdf)
* [Data-Driven Inference of Representation Invariants](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~amiltner/hanoi.pdf)
